## 🔧 Built With

- Ruby
- Rubocop linter

## 🔴 Live Demo

[Live Demo Link](https://repl.it/join/wtscdvoa-marcoshdezcam1)

## 🛠 Getting Started
## Install 
Besides the live demo link, you can run those functions in you own local environment. In order to run, you need to install Ruby in your computer. For windows you can go to [Ruby installer](https://rubyinstaller.org/) and for MAC and LINUX you can go to [Ruby official site](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/) for intructions on how to intall it.

## Testing
This enumerable methods where tested using [RSpec](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSpec), which is a Domain-specific Language testing tool written in Ruby, to test Ruby code.
### Install RSpec
